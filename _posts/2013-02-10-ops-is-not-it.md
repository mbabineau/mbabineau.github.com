Don't confuse ops with office IT. Hire someone else for that.

In a growing startup, it's common to pawn off tasks like setting up the new hire's laptop or fixing the printer to your ops guy. After all, that's what sysadmins do, right?

Wrong. You hired your ops guy to run your site's infrastructure. Time spent on fixing printers is time *not* spent on monitoring, logging, automation, or countless other systems critical to keeping your site up and running. Having your ops guy figure out why Jim's machine "feels slow" is as reasonable as having your UI designer repaint the office.

All that said, broken printers and slow laptops *are* disruptive. Office IT is an important business function, so hire someone to own it.

But what if you can't justify the headcount? Contract it out. Put someone on retainer for 8 hours a week, have them come in every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon. It's cheaper than another ops guy, minimizes context switching, and office IT problems won't be de-prioritized to oblivion.

Find someone who does this for a living. Your ops guy and your printer will thank you.
