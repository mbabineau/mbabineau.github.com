{% include JB/setup %}

Since it looks like EA2D's GitHub account has been deleted (the group doesn't exist anymore), I've moved the (kinda) maintained versions of several open source projects to my personal account.

The includes:
- [pingdom-python](https://github.com/mbabineau/loggly-python) - Python library for Pingdom's REST API
- [loggly-python](https://github.com/mbabineau/loggly-python) - Python library for Loggly's REST API
- [loggly-cookbook](https://github.com/mbabineau/loggly-python) - Chef coookbook for Loggly
