I've launched a new service for graphing Amazon CloudWatch metrics, [Cloudgrapher](https://www.cloudgrapher.com).  It's free, it's based off of [cloudviz](https://github.com/mbabineau/cloudviz) and Google App Engine, and I think EC2 users (especially those with highly dynamic environments) will find it pretty handy.

For more info, check out the [announcement](http://cloudgrapher.posterous.com/introducing-cloudgrapher) on the [Cloudgrapher blog](http://cloudgrapher.posterous.com/).  Or just head on over to [http://www.cloudgrapher.com/]((https://www.cloudgrapher.com)) and give it a try!  It's free and requires zero setup - what's not to like?
